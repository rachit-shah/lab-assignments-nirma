Country Music," Some people say a man is made out of mud A poor mans made out of muscle and blood Muscle and blood and skin and bones A mind thats weak and a back thats strong  You load sixteen tons and whattaya get? Another day older and deeper in debt St. Peter doncha call me cause I cant go I owe my soul to the company store  I was born one morning when the sun didnt shine I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal And the straw boss said, ""Well, bless my soul""  You load sixteen tons and whattaya get? Another day older and deeper in debt St. Peter doncha call me cause I cant go I owe my soul to the company store  I was born one morning, it was drizzlin rain Fightin and trouble are my middle name I was raised in the Cane break by an old mama lion Cant no high-toned woman make me walk the line  You load sixteen tons and whattaya get?

Country Music," Living on the road my friend, is gonna keep you free and clean. Now you wear your skin like iron, and your breath is hard as kerosene. You werent your mamas only boy, but her favourite one it seems. She began to cry when you said goodbye, and sank into your dreams.  Pancho was a bandit boy, his horse was fast as polished steel. He wore his gun outside his pants, for all the honest world to feel. Pancho met his match, you know, on the deserts down in Mexico. Nobody heard his dying words; ah, but thats the way it goes.  All the Federales say, They could have had him any day. They only let him slip away, Out of kindness, I suppose.  Lefty, he cant sing the blues all night long like he used to. The dust that Pancho bit down south ended up in Leftys mouth. The day they laid poor Pancho low, Lefty split for Ohio. Where he got the bread to go, there aint nobody knows.  All the Federales say, They could have had him any day. They only let him slip away, Out of kindness, I suppose.  The poets tell how Pancho fell, and Leftys living in cheap hotels. The deserts quiet, Clevelands cold, and so the story ends were told. Pancho needs your prayers its true, but save a few for Lefty too. He only did what he had to do, and now hes growing old.  (All the Federales say, They could have had him any day.) They only let him go so long, Out of kindness, I suppose.  A few grey Federales say They could have had him any day. They only let him go so long, Out of kindness, I suppose. ",WILLIE NELSON & MERLE HAGGARD - PANCHO AND LEFTY LYRICS

When Im called off I got a sawed off. Squeeze the trigger And bodies are hauled off. You too, boy, if you fuck with me The police are gonna have to come and get me Off your ass. Thats how Im going out For the punk motherfuckers thats showing out Niggaz start to mumble They want to rumble Mix them and cook them in a pot like Gumbo. Going off on a motherfucker like that With a gat thats pointed at your ass. So give it up smooth. Aint no telling when Im down for a jack move. Heres a murder rap to keep ya dancing With a crime record like Charles Manson. AK-47 is the tool. Dont make me act a motherfucking fool. Me and you can go toe to toe, no maybe Im knocking niggaz out the box daily. Yo weekly, monthly, and yearly Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly That Im down with the capital C-P-T. Boy, you cant fuck with me. So when Im in your neighborhood You better duck cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck. As I leave, believe Im stomping  But when I come back, boy  Im coming straight outta Compton.  Straight outta Compton, Straight outta Compton  2 (MC Ren) Yo Ren! Wassup? Tell em where ya from Straight outta Compton Another crazy ass nigga. More punks I smoke Yo my rep gets bigger. Im a bad motherfucker and you know this But the pussy ass niggaz wont show this. But I dont give a fuck, Imma make my snaps If not from the records, from jacking, or craps. Its like burglary, the definition is jacking Or when illegally armed, its called packing. Shoot a motherfucker in a minute I find a good piece of pussy, and go up in it. So if youre at a show in the front row Imma call you a bitch or a dirty ass ho. Youll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to But that shows me what youre composed to A crazy motherfucker from the street. Attitude legit, cause Im tearing up shit. MC Ren controls the automatic For any dumb motherfucker that starts static. Not the right hand, cause Im the hand itself Every time, I pull a AK off the shelf.  Security is maximum and thats a law. R-E-N spells Ren, but Im raw. See, cause Im the motherfucking villain.  The definition is clear  Youre the witness of a killing Thats taking place without a clue. And once youre on the scope  Your ass is through. Look, you might take it as a trip But a nigga like Ren is on a gangster tip. Straight outta Compton. Straight outta Compton, Staright outta Compton 3 (Eazy-E) Robin is his name, and the boys commin Straight outta Compton Is a brother thatll smother your mother And make your sister think I love her. Dangerous motherfucker raising hell And if I ever get caught I make bail. See, I dont give a fuck, thats the problem. I see a motherfucking cop, I dont dodge him But Im smart, lay low, creep a while And when I see the punk pass, I smile. To me its kind of funny The attitude is showing Nigga driving But dont know where the fuck he going.  Just rolling Looking for the one they call Eazy But heres the flash: They never seize me. Ruthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark Except when I unload. You see, its fun to jump over a hesitation And hear the scream of the one who caught the lead penetration  Feel a little gust of wind and Im jetting But leave a memory, no one will be forgetting. So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her! You think I give a damn about a bitch? I aint a sucker. This is an autobiography of the E And if you ever fuck with me Youll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother. Word to the motherfucker. Straight outta Compton. Straight outta Compton, Straight outta Compton Damn, that shit was dope! ",N.W.A. - STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON LYRICS

Ready to give up so I seek the Old Earth Who explained working hard may help you maintain To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain We got stickup kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot Leave it up to me while I be living proof To kick the truth to the young black youth But shortys running wild smokin sess drinkin beer And aint trying to hear what Im kickin in his ear Neglected, but now, but yo, it gots to be accepted That what?

Hip Hop/Rap," So, youre a philosopher? Yes, yes, yes, yes I think very deeply I think very deeply, I think very deeply I think, I think, I think very deeply In about four seconds the teacher will begin to speak I think very deeply  Lets begin, what, where, why, or when Will all be explained like instructions to a game See Im not insane, in fact, Im kind of rational When I be asking you, ""Who is more dramatical?""  This one or that one, the white one or the black one Pick the punk and Ill jump up to attack one KRS-One is just the guy to lead a crew Right up to your face and dis you  Everyone saw me on the last album cover Holding a pistol something far from a lover Beside my brother, S C O T T I just laughed, cause no one can defeat me  This is lecture number two, my philosophy Number one, was poetry you know its me This is my philosophy, many artists got to learn Im not flammable, I dont burn  So please stop burnin and learn to earn respect Cause thats just what KR collects See, what do you expect when you rhyme like a soft punk You walk down the street and get jumped  You got to have style and learn to be original And everybodys gonna wanna diss you Like me, we stood up for the South Bronx And every sucka MC had a response  You think we care? I know that they are on the tip My posse from the Bronx is thick And were real live, we walk correctly A lot of suckas would like to forget me  But they cant, cause like a champ I have got a record of knocking out the frauds in a second On the mic, I believe that you should get loose I havent come to tell you I got juice I just produce, create, innovate on a higher level Ill be back, but for now just seckle  [Incomprehensible] In about four seconds the teacher will begin to speak  Ill play the nine and you play the target You all know my name so I guess Ill just start it Or should I say, ""Start this,"" I am an artist Of new concepts at their hardest  Cause, yo, Im a teacher and Scott is a scholar It aint about money cause we all make dollars Thats why I walk with my head up When I hear wack rhymes I get fed up  Rap is like a set-up, a lot of games A lot of suckas with colorful names Im so-and-so, Im this, Im that But they all just wick-wick-wack  Im not white or red or black Im brown from the Boogie Down Productions, of course our music be thumpin Others say their bad, but theyre buggin  Let me tell you somethin now about hip hop About D-Nice, Melodie, and Scott La Rock Ill get a pen, a pencil, a marker Mainly what I write is for the average New Yorker  Some MCs be talkin and talkin Tryin to show how black people are walkin But I dont walk this way to portray Or reinforce stereotypes of today  Like all my brothas eat chicken and watermelon Talk broken English and drug sellin See Im tellin and teaching real facts The way some act in rap is kind of wack  And it lacks creativity and intelligence But they dont care cause the company is sellin it Its my philosophy on the industry Dont bother dissin me or even wish that wed  Soften, dilute, or commercialize all our lyrics Cause its about time one of yall hear it And hear it first-hand from the intelligent brown man A vegetarian, no goat or ham  Or chicken or turkey or hamburger Cause to me thats suicide self-murder Let us get back to what we call hip hop And what it meant to DJ Scott La Rock  Youre a philosopher? Yes, I think very deeply I think very deeply In about four seconds the teacher will begin to speak  How many MCs must get dissed Before somebody says, ""Dont fuck with Kris"" This is just one style, out of many Like a piggy bank, this is one penny  My brothers name is Kenny thats, Kenny Parker My other brother I.C.U. is much darker Boogie Down Productions is made up of teachers The lecture is conducted from the mic into the speaker  Who gets weaker? The king or the teacher Its not about a salary its all about reality Teachers teach and do the world good Kings just rule and most are never understood  If you were to rule or govern a certain industry All inside this room right now would be in misery No one would get along  nor sing a song Cause everyoned be singing for the king, am I wrong?  So yo, whats up, its me again Scott La Rock, KRS, BDP again Many people had the nerve to think we would end the trend Were criminal minded, an album which is only ten  Funky, funky, funky, funky, funky hit records No more than four minutes and some seconds The competition checks and checks and keeps checkin They take the album, take it home, and start sweatin  Why? well its simple, to them its kind of vital To take KRS-Ones title To them Im like an idol, some type of entity In everybodys rhyme they wanna mention me?  Or rather mention us, me or Scott La Rock But they can get bust, get robbed, get dropped I dont play around nor do I F around And you can tell by the bodies that are left around  When some clown jumps up to get beat down Broken down to his very last compound See how it sounds? A little unrational A lot of MCs like to use the word dramatical Fresh for 88, you suckas ",BOOGIE DOWN PRODUCTIONS - MY PHILOSOPHY LYRICS

Hip Hop/Rap," This here’s a jam for all the fellas Tryin’ to do what those ladies tell us. Get shot down ’cause you’re overzealous, Play hard to get, females get jealous. OK smarty, go to a party, Girls are scantily clad and showin’ body. A chick walks by you wish you could sex her, But you’re standin’ on the wall like you was Poindexter.  Next day’s function, high class luncheon, Food is served and you’re stone cold munchin’. Music comes on, people start to dance But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants. A girl starts walkin’, guys start gawkin’, Sits down next to you and starts talkin’. Says she wanna dance ’cause she likes the groove, So come on, fatso, and just bust a move.  (vocal scatting) Just bust a move!  You’re on a mission and you’re wishin’ Someone could cure your lonely condition. Lookin’ for love in all the wrong places, No fine girls, just ugly faces. From frustration, first inclination Is to become a monk and leave the situation. But every dark tunnel has a lighter hope, So don’t hang yourself with a celibate rope.  New movie’s showin’, so you’re goin’ Could care less about the five you’re blowin’ Theatre gets dark just to start the show Then you spot a fine woman sittin’ in your row She’s dressed in yellow, she says “Hello, Come sit next to me, you fine fellow!” You run over there without a second to lose, And what comes next? Hey, bust a move!  If you want it, you got it. If you want it, baby, you got it. (Just bust a move!) If you want it, you got it. If you want it, baby, you got it.  In the city, ladies look pretty. Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty. Tell a funny joke just to get some play, Then you try to make a move and she says, “no way.” Girls are fakin’, goodness sakin’, They want a man who brings home the bacon. Got no money and you got no car, Then you got no woman and there you are.  Some girls are sophistic, materialistic, Looking for a man makes them opportunistic. They’re lyin’ on the beach perpetratin’ a tan So that a brother with money can be their man. So on the beach you’re strollin’, real high-rollin’, Everything you have is yours and not stolen. A girl runs up with somethin’ to prove, So don’t just stand there, bust a move!  If you want it, you got it. If you want it, baby, you got it. (Just bust a move) If you want it, you got it If you want it, baby, you got it. (Break it down for me fellas)  (vocal scatting)  Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry, In five days from now he’s gonna marry. He’s hopin’ you can make it there if you can, ‘Cause in the ceremony you’ll be the best man. You say neato, check your libido, And roll to the church in your new tuxedo. The bride walks down just to start the wedding, And there’s one more girl you won’t be getting. So you start thinkin’, then you start blinkin’. A bride maid looks and thinks that you’re winkin’. She thinks you’re kinda cute so she winks back, And now you’re feelin really fine ’cause the girl is stacked. Reception’s jumpin’, bass is pumpin’, Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin’. Says she wants to dance to a different groove. Now you know what to do, G, bust a move!  If you want it, you got it. If you want it, baby, you got it. (Just bust a move) If you want it, you got it. If you want it, baby, you got it. (Move it, boy)  (vocal scatting) ",YOUNG MC - BUST A MOVE LYRICS

Let me drop some shit like this here, real smooth   [Verse 1: Scarface]  At night I cant sleep, I toss and turn  Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned  Four walls just staring at a nigga  Im paranoid, sleeping with my finger on the trigger  My mothers always stressin I aint living right  But I aint going out without a fight  See, every time my eyes close  I start sweating and blood starts coming out my nose  Its somebody watching the Ak  But I dont know who it is, so Im watching my back  I can see him when Im deep in the covers  When I awake I dont see the motherfucker  He owns a black hat like I own  A black suit and a caine like my own  Some might say, ""Take a chill, B.""  But fuck that shit! Theres a nigga trying to kill me  Im poppin in the clip when the wind blows  Every 20 seconds got me peeping out my window  Investigating the joint for traps  Checking my telephone for taps  Im staring at the woman on the corner  Its fucked up when your minds playing tricks on ya   [Verse 2: Willie D]  I make big money, I drive big cars  Everybody know me; its like Im a movie star  But late at night, something aint right  I feel Im being tailed by the same suckers headlights  Is it that fool that I ran off the block?  Or is it that nigga last week that I shot?  Or is it the one I beat for 5000 dollars?  Thought he had caine, but it was Gold Medal flour  Reached under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers  Aint no use to me lying  I was scareder than a motherfucker  Hooked a left into Popeyes and bailed out quick  If its going down, lets get this shit over with  Here they come just like I figured  I got my hand on the motherfucking trigger  What I sawll make your ass start gigglin  Three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens  I live by the sword  I take my boys everywhere I go, because Im paranoid  I keep looking over my shoulder  And peeping around corners; my mind is playing tricks on me   [Verse 3: Scarface]  Day by day its more impossible to cope  I feel like Im the one thats doing dope  Cant keep a steady hand, because Im nervous  Every Sunday morning Im in service  Praying for forgiveness  And tryin to find an exit out the business  I know the Lord is looking at me  But yet and still its hard for me to feel happy  I often drift while I drive  Having fatal thoughts of suicide  Bang and get it over with  And then Im worry-free, but thats bullshit  I got a little boy to look after  And if I died then my child would be a bastard  I had a woman down with me  But to me it seemed like she was down to get me  She helped me out in this shit  But to me she was just another bitch  Now shes back with her mother  Now Im realizing that I love her  Now Im feeling lonely  My mind is playing tricks on me   [Verse 4: Bushwick Bill]  This year Halloween fell on a weekend  Me and Geto Boys are trick-or-treatin  Robbing little kids for bags  Till a law man got behind our ass  So we speeded up the pace  Took a look back and he was right before our face  Hed be in for a squabble, no doubt  So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth  He was going down we figured  But this wasnt no ordinary nigga  He stood about six or seven feet  Now thats the nigga Id be seeing in my sleep  So we triple-teamed on him  Dropping them motherfucking Bs on him  The more I swung, the more blood flew  Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too  Then I felt just like a fiend  It wasnt even close to Halloween  It was dark as fuck on the streets  My hands were all bloody, from punching on the concrete  God damn, homie  My mind is playing tricks on me ",GETO BOYS - MIND PLAYING TRICKS ON ME LYRICS

Hip Hop/Rap," When Im alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call Telling me I need a girl whos as sweet as a dove For the first time in my life, I see I need love There I was giggling about the games That I had played with many hearts and Im not saying no names Then the thought occurred, tear drops made my eyes burn Coz I said to myself look what youve done to her I can feel it inside, I cant explain how it feels All I know is that Ill never dish another raw deal  Playing make believe pretending that Im true Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you Saying amor, kissing you on the ear Whispering I love you and Ill always be here Although I often reminisce I cant believe that I found A desire for true love floating around Inside my soul because my soul is cold And half of me deserves to be this way till Im old But the other half needs affection and joy And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy  I need love I need love  Romance sheer delight how sweet I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete You can scratch my back, well get cozy and huddle Ill lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle Ill give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat Kiss you on the cheek and say ooo girl youre so sweet Its deja vu whenever Im with you I could go on forever telling you what I do  But where you at youre neither here or there I swear I cant find you anywhere Damn sure you aint in my closet, or under my rug This love search is really making me bug And if you know who you are, why dont you make yourself seen Take the chance with my love and youll find out what I mean Fantasys can run but they cant hide And when I find you Im gon pour all my love inside  I need love I need love  I wanna kiss you, hold you never scold you just love you Suck on you neck, caress you and rub you Grind moan and never be alone If youre not standing next to me youre on the phone Cant you hear it in my voice, I need love bad Ive got money but loves something Ive never had I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all I love you more than a man whos ten feet tall  Id watch the sunrise in your eyes Were so in love when we hug we become paralyzed Our bodies explode in ecstasy unreal Youre as soft as a pillow and Im as hard as steel Its like a dream land, I cant lie I never been there Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet I swear to you this is something Ill never forget  I need love I need love  See what I mean Ive changed Im no longer A play boy on the run I need something thats stronger Friendship, trust honor respect admiration This whole experience has been such a revelation Its taught me love and how to be a real man To always be considerate and do all I can Protect you youre my lady and you mean so much My body tingles all over from the slightest touch of your hand  And understand Ill be frozen in time Till we meet face to face and you tell me youre mine If I find you girl I swear Ill be a good man Im not gonna leave it in destinys hands I cant sit and wait for my princess to arrive I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive Ill search the whole world for that special girl When I finally find you watch our love unfurl  I need love I need love  Girl, listen to me When I be sittin in my room all alone, staring at the wall Fantasies, they go through my mind And Ive come to realize that I need true love And if you wanna give it to me girl make yourself seen Ill be waiting, I love you ",LL COOL J - I NEED LOVE LYRICS

Hip Hop/Rap," Uncle Ricky, could you read us a bedtime story?  Please, huh, please?  Alright, you kids get to bed, Ill get the storybook  Yall tucked in? Yeah, here we go   Once upon a time, not long ago  Where people wore pajamas and lived life slow  Where laws were stern and justice stood  And people were behavin like they ought to good   There lived a little boy who was misled  By another little boy and this is what he said  Me and you Tike, were gonna make some cash  Robbin old folks and makin the dash   They did the job, money came with ease  But one couldnt stop, its like he had a disease  He robbed another and another and a sister and a brother  Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover   The cop grabbed his arm, he started actin erratic  He said, ""Keep still boy, no need for static""  Punched him in his belly and gave him a slap  But little did he know, the little boy was strapped   The kid pulled outta gun, he said, ""Whyd you hit me?""  The barrel was set straight for the cops kidney  The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure  Ill do years if I pull this trigger   So he cold dashed and ran around the block  Cop radios in to another lady cop  He ran by a tree, there he saw the sister  Shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her   Looked round good and from expectations  He decided hed head for the subway stations  But she was coming and he made a left  He was running top speed till he was out of breath   Knocked and old man down and swore he killed him  Then he made his move to an abandoned building  Ran up the stairs up to the top floor  Opened up a door, there guess who he saw   Dave, the dope fiend shootin dope  Who dont know the meaning of water nor soap?  He said, ""I need bullets, hurry up, run""  The dope fiend rolled back a spankin shot gun   He went outside but there were cops all over  Then he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova  Raced up the block doin 83  Crashed into a tree, near university   Escaped alive, though the car was battered  Rat-a-tat-tatered and all the cops scattered  Ran out of bullets and he still had static  Grabbed the pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic   Point it at her head, he said the gun was full of lead  He told the cops, ""Back off or honey heres dead""  Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong  So he let the lady go and he starts to run on   Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded  And before long the boy got surrounded  He dropped his gun so went the glory  And this is the way I have to end this story   He was only one teen in a madmans dream  The cops shot the kid, I still here him scream  This aint funny, so dont ya dare laugh  Just another case about the wrong path  Straight and narrow or your soul gets cast  Goodnight   [Incomprehensible]  I know this story is really weird  [Incomprehensible]  Goodnight ",SLICK RICK - CHILDREN'S STORY LYRICS

I think its one of those de ja vu things,  or a dream thats tryin to tell me something.  Or will I ever stop thinkin about it.  I dont know, I doubt it.  Subterranean by design,  I wonder what I would find if I met you,  let my eyes caress you,  until I meet the thought of Missess Princess Who?  Often wonder what makes her work.  I guess Ill leave that question to the experts,  assuming that there are some out there.  theyre probably alone, solitaire.  I can remember when I caught up  with a pastime intimate friend.  She said, ""Bet youre probably gonna say I look lovely,  but you probably dont think nothin of me.""  She was right, though, I cant lie.  Shes just one of those corners in my mind,  and I just put her right back with the rest.  Thats the way it goes, I guess.   Baby you send me  Set adrift on memory bliss of you   Careless whisper from a careless man,  a neutron dance for a neutron fan;  marionette strings are dangerous things,  I thought of all the trouble they bring.  An eye for an eye, a spy for a spy,  rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh.  Tell me that shes not dreaming.  Shes got an ace in the hole,  it doesnt have meaning.  Reality used to be a friend of mine,  cause complete control, I dont take too kind.  Christina Applegate, you gotta put me on.  Guess whos piece of the cake is Jack gone?  She broke her wishbone and wished for a sign.  I told her whispers in my heart were fine.  what did she think she could do?  I feel for her, I really do.  The next day I had the ring finger on her hand,  I wanted her to be a big PM Dawn fan,  but I had to put her right back with the rest.  Thats the way it goes, I guess.   Baby you send me...

Hip Hop/Rap," DJ Jazzy Jeff And The Fresh Prince Hes The DJ, Im The Rapper Parents Just Dont Understand You know parents are the same   No matter time nor place   They dont understand that us kids   Are going to make some mistakes   So to you, all the kids all across the land   Theres no need to argue   Parents just dont understand   I remember one year   My mom took me school shopping   It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister   All hopped in the car   We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall   My mom started bugging with the clothes she chose   I didnt say nothing at first   I just turned up my nose   She said, ""Whats wrong? This shirt cost $20""   I said, ""Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!""   The next half hour was the same old thing   My mother buying me clothes from 1963   And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate   I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!   I said, ""Mom, what are you doing, youre ruining my rep""   She said, ""Youre only sixteen, you dont have a rep yet""   I said, ""Mom, lets put these clothes back, please""   She said ""no, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show""   I said, ""This isnt Sha Na Na, come on Mom, Im not Bowzer   Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers   But if you dont want to I can live with that but   You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks""   She wasnt moved - everything stayed the same   Inevitably the first day of school came   I thought I could get over, I tried to play sick   But my mom said, ""No, no way, uh-uh, forget it""   There was nothing I could do, I tried to relax   I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts   And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought   The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought   And those who werent laughing still had a ball   Because they were pointing and whispering   As I walked down the hall   I got home and told my Mom how my day went   She said, ""If they were laughing you dont need the,   ""Cause theyre not good friends""   For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom   That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times   So to you all the kids all across the land   Theres no need to argue   Parents just dont understand   Oh-kay, heres the situation   My parents went away on a weeks vacation and   They left the keys to the brand new Porsche   Would they mind?   Umm, well, of course not   Ill just take it for a little spin   And maybe show it off to a couple of friends   Ill just cruise it around the neighborhood   Well, maybe I shouldnt   Yeah, of course I should   Pay attention, heres the thick of the plot   I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block   Thats when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking   I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking   You shouldve seen this girls bodily dimensions   I honked my horn just to get her attention   She said, ""Was that for me?""   I said, ""Yeah""   She said, ""Why?""   I said, ""Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy""   She said, ""How do I know youre not sick?   You could be some deranged lunatic""   I said, ""Cmon toots - my name is the Prince =   Beside, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?""   She agreed and we were on our way   She was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word   We hit McDonalds, pulled into the drive   We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes   She kicked her shoes off onto the floor   She said, ""Drive fast, speed turns me on""   She put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas   We almost got whiplash, I took off so fast   The sun roof was open , the music was high   And this girls hand was steadily moving up my thigh   She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far   I guess thats why I didnt notice that police car   Were doing ninety in my Moms new Porsche   And to make this long story short - short   When the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell   I said, ""I dont have a license but I drive very well, officer""   I almost had a heart attack that day   Come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway   I was arrested, the car was impounded   There was no way for me to avoid being grounded   My parents had to come off from vacation to get me   Id rather be in jail than to have my father hit me   My parents walked in   I got my grip, I said, ""Ah, Mom, Dad, how was your trip?""   They didnt speak   I said, ""I want to plead my case""   But my father just shoved me in the car by my face   That was a hard ride home, I dont know how I survived   They took turns -   One would beat me while the other one was driving   I cant believe it, I just made a mistake   Well parents are the same no matter time nor place   So to you all the kids all across the land   Take it from me   Parents just dont understand ",DJ JAZZY JEFF AND THE FRESH PRINCE - PARENTS JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND LYRICS

""Oh, hes just a friend""  Dont gimme that, dont ever gimme that  Jus bust this   You, you got what I need but you say hes just a friend  And you say hes just a friend, oh baby  You, you got what I need but you say hes just a friend  But you say hes just a friend, oh baby  You, you got what I need but you say hes just a friend  But you say hes just a friend   So I came to her college on a surprise visit  To see my girl that was so exquisite  It was a school day, I knew she was there  The first semester of the school year  I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm  This guy made me fill out a visitors form  He told me where it was and I as on my way  To see my baby doll, I was happy to say  I arrrived in front of the dormitory  Yo, could you tell me where is door three?  They showed me where it was for the moment  I didnt know I was in for such an event  So I came to her room and opened the door  Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?  A fella tongue-kissin my girl in the mouth,  I was so in shock my heart went down south  So please listen to the message that I say  Dont ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend ",BIZ MARKIE - JUST A FRIEND LYRICS

Pop," On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night There she stood in the doorway; I heard the mission bell And I was thinking to myself, ""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"" Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say...  Welcome to the Hotel California Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place) Such a lovely face Plenty of room at the Hotel California Any time of year (Any time of year) You can find it here  Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat. Some dance to remember, some dance to forget  So I called up the Captain, ""Please bring me my wine"" He said, ""We havent had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine"" And still those voices are calling from far away, Wake you up in the middle of the night Just to hear them say...

To be on your own With no direction home A complete unknown Like a rolling stone  You never turned around to see the frowns On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you Never understood that it aint no good You shouldnt let other people get your kicks for you  You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat Aint it hard when you discover that he really wasnt where its at? After he took from you everything he could steal  How does it feel? How does it feel?

How does it feel? To be on your own With no direction home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stone ",BOB DYLAN - LIKE A ROLLING STONE LYRICS

So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how Another body laying cold in the gutter. Listen to me.  Dont go chasing waterfalls.

I muttered somethin underneath my breath She studied the lines on my face I must admit, felt a little uneasy When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe Tangled up in blue  She lit a burner on the stove And offered me a pipe ""I thought youd never say hello,"" she said ""You look like the silent type""  Then she opened up a book of poems And handed it to me Written by an Italian poet From the thirteenth century  And every one of them words rang true And glowed like burnin coal Pourin off of every page Like it was written in my soul from me to you Tangled up in blue  I lived with them on Montague Street In a basement down the stairs There was music in the cafes at night And revolution in the air  Then he started into dealing with slaves And something inside of him died She had to sell everything she owned And froze up inside  And when it finally, the bottom fell out I became withdrawn The only thing I knew how to do Was to keep on keepin on like a bird that flew Tangled up in blue  So now Im goin back again I got to get to her somehow All the people we used to know Theyre an illusion to me now  Some are mathematicians Some are carpenters wives Dont know how it all got started I dont know what theyre doin with their lives  But me, Im still on the road headin for another joint We always did feel the same We just saw it from a different point of view Tangled up in blue ",BOB DYLAN - TANGLED UP IN BLUE LYRICS

When the ice that clings on to, your beard is screaming agony And you snatch your rattling last breaths with deep-sea diver sounds And the flowers bloom like madness in the spring ",JETHRO TULL - AQUALUNG LYRICS

I mean the macaronis soggy, the peas are mushed And the chicken tastes like wood  So you try to play it off like you think you can By sayin that youre full And then your friend says, ""Momma, hes just being polite He aint finished, uh uh, thats bull!""  So your heart starts pumpin, and you think of a lie And you say that you already ate And your friend says, ""Man, theres plenty of food!"" So you pile some more on your plate  While the stinky foods steamin your mind starts to dreamin Of the moment that its time to leave And then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin Into something that looks like cheese  Oh so, you say, ""Thats it, I got to leave this place I dont care what these people think Im just sittin here makin myself nauseous With this ugly food that stinks!""  So you bust out the door while its still closed Still sick from the food you ate And then you run to the store for quick relief From a bottle of Kaopectate  And then you call your friend two weeks later To see how he has been And he says, ""I understand about the food, baby bubbah But were still friends""  With a hip hop, the hippie to the hippie The hip hip-a hop-a you dont stop the rockin To the bang bang boogie say up jump the boogie To the rhythm of the boogie the beat  I say, Hank, can ya rock? Can ya rock to the rhythm that just dont stop? Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo? I said, come on make the, make the people move  I go to the halls and then ring the bell Because I am the man with the clientele And if ya ask me why I rock so well A big bang, I got clientele  And from the time I was only six years old I never forgot what I was told It was the best advice that I ever had It came from my wise dear old dad  He said, ""Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you And dont say a word until Im through Now, theres a time to laugh, a time to cry A time to live and a time to die  A time to break and a time to chill To act civilized or act real ill But whatever ya do in your lifetime Ynever let a MC steal your rhyme!""  So from sixty-six to this very day Ill always remember what he had to say So when the sucker MCs try to chump my style I let them know that Im versatile  I got style, finesse and a little black book Thats filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look But theres a thing that separates you from me And that is called originality  Because my rhymes are on from what you heard I didnt even bite and not a Goddamn word And I say a little more later on tonight So the sucker MCs can bite all night  A-tick a-tock yall, a-beat beat yall A-lets rock yall, ya dont stop Ya go hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today?
